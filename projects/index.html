                    <p>Description: We targeted on fitness market and tried some different ideas but the most success one 
                        was Fiit like an online personal trainer (PT). Fiit acts like an online trainer including: 
                        workout exercises, nutrition program, tips and guide based on body factors. Fiit would collect user factors and 
                        generate a specific workout program for every user (almost nobody like each other).</p>
                    <p>My task: I was the only guy who took care of technology and product development. I designed a database and architect to make the application work.
                        We used React.js, iOS app as front-ends and Java Spring Boot served as RESTful API back-end.
                    </p>
                    <p>Achievement: We gained over 1000 users, go live MVP web app and iOS app on Appstore, this idea also started generating revenue.</p>
